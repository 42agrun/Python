## About this project
This experimental Python app is meant to explore basic concepts of **facial recognition patterns** via the public library known as OpenCV.

This app attempts to count the number of "smiles" the user performs. Opening your mouth should suffice to trigger the algorithm.

**Here are some of the insights I've gained:**
*   **
* Webcams can't be used by more than one application at once.
    * Challenge: how to embed support systems for physically disadvantaged users who also want to use videochat?
*   **
* Pattern recognition via the publicly available cascade models tends to be rather inaccurate.
    * Challenge: which alterations are required to compensate for these shortcomings?
    * Challenge: heavy focus on graytones. Are there instances where colors are crucial for recognition?
